# learning-c
# my experience of learning 
# so ,this may be meaningless to you, but to me it means a lot.
# this is the first time i use github, and justnow I successfully add an commit to it . 
# I am really exited about itï¼Œhopping one day I will be an outstanding one
# I find that I am a lot different from people surrending me , and I find that the spirit of open source cheered me so much 
# I like these kind of peoples , and I am going to be one
# It is a little bit pity that I started this creer just a month ago, my time is vary limited now , how much I wish I could 
# years ago , if so , I would not have wasted much time doing the meaningless things, and by now , I could be a lot different
# but , it was nearly impossible to be so , because no one was guiding me , and I was searching ways myself .
# and this was a big coincidence that I got into this way . Much thanks to the cheater who almost theated ten thousand RMB 
# from me . From that time I start to get interested in protecting privicy, and then I find some thing ,and I want to dig the 
# datas out ,  I find python , I borrowed the book <learning python>, and planing to learn , actually I have learned 100pages 
# I find this is very interesting, few days latter I find this is the just thing I want to do and decided to make this my carrer
# Actually I want to learning python first, but the book I borrowed was written in english, the time I borrowed I was thinking 
# I could learn python as well as english, that very good , but there is a problem, in that way , I learn very slow, I am not 
# able to read english as I  read mother language, a lot vocabulary I need to search for meanings . It cost a lot time, and it 
# cost me ten days only to got to the 100th page,  and as I have said before , my time is very limited now, only eight months 
# left before I graduate, and meanwhile I alse have other annoying stuff to do. So I decided to learn C language first, because 
# I have learnt some before. and now , three weeks latter I have read through the c part of the <c how to program>.  and now 
# I am trying to write the codes appeared in the book without referering to it , so that's what this repository will contain.
# Thanks for the cheater ! you brought me to this way, without you , I wonder when it will be the time that I take my first
# step here . just as Lao-tzu(the acient chinese philosopher) said, dander hides in fortrune, while luck comes with 
# the face of devil.  
# so ,that's it .   I will be very happy to know you guys here
